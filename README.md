# CodeGreen_DataVis
Data Visualisation of Carbon footprint due to computation (Environmentally Friendly Web Application Comparison)

In this project, we've built two web applications with the same functionality but utilizing different programming languages. Our aim was to compare their environmental
impact in terms of electricity consumption and CO2 emissions, to make a more informed and eco-friendly tech choice.

🎯 Objective

With the increasing importance of sustainability, we've taken up the challenge to analyze and compare the environmental impacts of two web applications.
One is built with JavaScript, and the other with Python. Our aim? To encourage more eco-friendly tech choices.

📁 Dataset

Our dataset is created using the Code Carbon library and is saved as a CSV file. It provides information about the carbon footprint from computing tasks. 
Users can upload this dataset (DataFinal.csv) to our web application to see and interact with the data, getting a clear picture of the environmental effects.
If you wish to experiment with an alternate dataset, ensure it aligns with our established criteria and format.

📌 Methodologies

1. Stack I: 


Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Plotly.js
Our methodology combines HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Plotly.js to deliver an interactive web application that allows users to upload data, interact with it,
and see various visualizations.


2. Stack II: 

Technologies: Python, Plotly, Dash, HTML, Flask
Our methodology combines Python, Plotly, Dash, HTML, and Flask to create a web application that allows users to upload data, interact with it,
and see various visualizations.


🤖 Automation Workflow

Follow these steps to visualize the carbon emissions:
1) We've got two automation scripts at your disposal: run.js and auto.py.
2) Kick things off by entering the run.js or auto.py command in your terminal. This action fires up the web application.
3) The magic begins! Carbon emissions start getting tracked using the Codecarbon library.
4) Want to see the data? Upload the DataFinal.csv file. You can also introduce a new dataset, just ensure it aligns with the required parameters.
5) Give it a moment. Wait for about 90 seconds to let the application do its thing.
6) Time to wrap things up. Shut down the web application.
7) The tracking stops.
8) Your data on emissions is neatly tucked away in the emissions.csv file.

📊 Results

Our findings? The two tech stacks differ slightly in their carbon footprints:

JavaScript: Treads heavier with an average emission of 0.00029.

Python: Steps lightly with an average emission of 0.00028.

This project shows that even minor tech decisions can ripple into significant environmental outcomes. Python emerged as the greener choice for this round.

🌱 Future Scope

Our vision is clear: Propel tech towards a greener future. By diving deeper into various programming languages and setting up benchmarks, we aim to:

🌿 Advocate coding practices that are gentle on the environment.
🤝 Build a community of devs conscious of their code's ecological footprints.
🚀 Lead the charge with innovations that balance tech prowess with environmental care.

Remember, coding isn't just about solving problems; it's about making choices that resonate with our values. Let's code green! 🍃
